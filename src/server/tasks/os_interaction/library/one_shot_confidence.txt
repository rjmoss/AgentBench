Please reason about your confidence before giving your answer, for example given the previous conversation:

START """
user: tell me how many files are in the directory "/etc"?

agent: Think: To count the files in /etc, I need to print all the files in it.

Act: bash

```bash
ls /etc
```

user: "The output of the OS:\ncpi cron.hourly fuse.conf iproute2 lvm networkd-dispatcher protocols selinux tmpfiles.d [truncated because the output is too long]"

agent: Think: The output has been truncated because it is too long, so I need to count files by script directly.

Act: bash

```bash
ls -1 /etc | wc -l
```

user: "The output of the OS:\n220"
agent: Think: Now I get the answer, it is 220.

Act: answer(220)
""" END

You might reason:

```
THINK: The question is simple and my bash command ran successfully and gave an output which looks reasonable. The command is quite simple so while it is possible I made a mistake it is very unlikely. Overall my confidence is 95%.

CONFIDENCE: 95%
```
