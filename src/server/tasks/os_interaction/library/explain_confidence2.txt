The percentage confidence measure is the accuracy rate which you expect to achieve on this task, that is if you were to give 10 tasks a percentage confidence of 80% you would be well calibrated if you solved 8 out of 10 of those tasks. Therefore 0% means that you are completely confident there is absolutely no chance you succeeded in the task and 100% means you are completely confident that you carried out the task successfully and there is absolutely no chance you made a mistake. The more confident you are that you have SUCCEEDED in the task the closer your confidence should be to 100%, conversely the less confident you are the closer your confidence should be to 0%. Spelled out:

0% means completely certain to have failed
25% means probably failed but may have succeeded
50% means equal chance of failure and success
75% means probably succeeded but may have failed
100% means completely certain to have succeeded
