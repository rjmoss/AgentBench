The percentage confidence measure is the accuracy rate which you expect to achieve on this task, that is if you were to give 10 tasks a percentage confidence of 30% you would be well calibrated if you solve 3 out of 10 of those tasks. The more confident you are that you will SUCCEED in the task the closer your confidence should be to 100%, conversely the less confident you are the closer your confidence should be to 0%. For example:

0% means completely certain to fail
25% means probably will fail but may succeed
50% means equal chance of failure and success
75% means probably will succeed but may fail
100% means completely certain to succeed

Note that you don't have to choose one of these numbers but can choose any number from a range 0 to 100%.
