The percentage confidence measure is the accuracy rate which you expect to achieve on this task, that is if you were to give 10 tasks a percentage confidence of 80% you would be well calibrated if you solved 8 out of 10 of those tasks. Therefore 0% means that you are completely confident there is absolutely no chance you succeeded in the task and 100% means you are completely confident that you carried out the task successfully and there is absolutely no chance you made a mistake. If you had a true/false question and you have to randomly guess then your confidence should be 50%. The more confident you are that you have SUCCEEDED in the task the closer your confidence should be to 100%, conversely the more confident you are that you have FAILED in the task the closer your confidence should be to 0%.
